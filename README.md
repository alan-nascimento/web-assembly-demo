# Introduction to WebAssembly

Demo for the PayPal's Web Conference 2023.

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format designed for safe and efficient execution in web browsers, allowing developers to run high-performance, low-level code in web applications, enabling near-native speed and access to many programming languages.

This repository includes the code examples used in the presentation.
Verify the `assembly-script` and `fibonacci` directories for further implementation details.
